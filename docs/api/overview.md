# API Overview

The Modulator API provides a set of endpoints to interact with the block editor system programmatically. It allows developers to manage blocks, customize editor settings, and integrate the editor into various applications.

## Key Concepts

- **Blocks**: The fundamental units of content in the editor, which can be created, updated, and deleted through the API.
- **Editor Settings**: Configurations that control the behavior and appearance of the editor.

## Architecture

The API is designed to be RESTful, providing a straightforward way to interact with the editor's capabilities. It supports JSON payloads and is secured via token-based authentication.
